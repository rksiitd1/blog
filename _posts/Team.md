# Building a Team: The Brutal Truth
Building a team is a brutal process, full of harsh realities that most don't want to face. Start with the truth: the world doesn’t care about dreams or visions. It’s indifferent. The only thing that matters is results. I leanred it the hard way, this wasn't clear from day one. Dreams are nothing without execution.

The first step is assembling a core team. Not just any group of people, but those who are willing to bleed(note the word) for the cause. It's about finding individuals who are not just skilled, but obsessed. The kind who lose sleep over missed opportunities and aren’t afraid to call out failures.

"The things that come in someone’s way are: A) Finances B) A core strong, die-heart group C) A strategy to move"​​.

Expect betrayals and disappointments. People will leave. They’ll choose stability and timidity over the exploration and courageousness. Accept it and move on. The mission is too important to get bogged down by deserters. At AIxB, those(ghosts) who stayed were those who saw beyond the immediate struggles.

Building a strategy isn't about fancy PowerPoint presentations. It’s about getting your hands dirty.
(In fact, I truly hate PowerPoint, I hate a professor who uses PowerPoint, I hate giving PowerPoint Presentation, If you have that zeal in you come and talk to me, to be more brutal, I would ask you to chat through virtual interafaces, one to one talks are are just to persuade people, people only exchange slogans nad rarely get time to think, there are two kinds of thinking: slow and fast, slow thinking is deep and more based)

"Building a product is not a problem; AI can build all the things. All you need are concepts and strategies"​​.

Collaboration is essential, but don’t mistake it for consensus. Tough decisions will be made that won’t please everyone. That’s leadership. At AIxB, from from the beginning I persued fostering an environment where ideas clash and the best ones emerge. That is the key. Mediocrity thrives on where critical thinking get closes its door. When this event occurs, be prepared to see the end.

"As the founder of AIxB, I am deeply committed to driving scientific innovation, fostering collaboration, and empowering a diverse team of brilliant minds to reach unprecedented heights"​​.

Technology is a tool, not a crutch. It can amplify efforts but won’t replace hard work. Those who rely solely on tech are doomed to fail. Technology enhances our capabilities, but it's the relentless drive of the team that propels us forward. AI won't do everything for you. Don't be lazy. Even if AI does everything for you, be prepared for war. When you will sleep, enemies would atack you. Keep your eyes wide open. 

"In the age of AI, everyone is just able to ask ChatGPT about how to do/build anything. If someone has to do something, they have to start and pivot, and the main thing is to build the brand so they can move on"​​.

Money is a constant struggle. Securing funding is cutthroat. Investors don’t care about passion; they care about returns. Managing finances with ruthless efficiency is non-negotiable. This was a harsh lesson learned at AIxB.

I repeat:
"The things that come in someone’s way are: A) Finances B) A core strong, die-heart group C) A strategy to move"​​.

Adaptability is survival. The world changes, often without warning. What worked yesterday will fail tomorrow. Stagnation is death. Being agile and ready to change course must be ingrained in the culture.

"Most people would say it’s daydreaming or would like to ridicule it, but most of them are not up to the mark to even understand the considerations"​​.

No Illusions:
Building a team isn't for the faint of heart. It’s a relentless pursuit of excellence where only the resilient survive. At AIxB, the journey is filled with scars and lessons learned the hard way. No sugarcoating. No illusions. Just the brutal, unfiltered truth of what it takes.
